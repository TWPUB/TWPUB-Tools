TWPUB is a new format for electronic publications that encourages readers to reuse and remix material, and explore new ways to support active reading.

We re-imagine electronic publications as dynamic, mouldable, customisable shared cultural assets. Our goal is to create an ecosystem of readers and libraries/stores that make it easy to create and consume these new-style publications. We hope that readers will come for the great experience, publishers will come to reach the readers, and that authors will be delighted with the increased reader engagement.
