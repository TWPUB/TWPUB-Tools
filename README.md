# TWPUB Tools

TWPUB is a new format for electronic publications that encourages readers to reuse and remix material, and explore new ways to support active reading.

We aim to re-imagine electronic publications as dynamic, mouldable, customisable shared cultural assets. Our goal is to create an ecosystem of readers and a library/store that makes it easy to create and consume these new-style publications. We hope that readers will come for the great experience, publishers will come to reach the readers, and that authors will be happy with the increased reader engagement.

## Introduction

This repository contains two tools:

* **epub2twpub** is a command line tool to convert EPUB files into TWPUB format
* **twpub-wiki/plugins/twpub-tools** is a TiddlyWiki plugin containing tools for viewing and annotating TWPUBs

The repository also contains:

* **bin** – scripts for working with the tools, including setting up a TiddlyWiki plugin library to contain the demo TWPUBs
* **epubs** – demonstration EPUB files
* **fixtures** – test fixtures for testing epub2twpub

## Setup

Install the latest Node.js and npm from https://nodejs.org/

Clone this repository and install its dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To install subsequent upstream changes from TiddlyWiki 5:

```
npm update
```

## Tests

To run the test suite:

```
npm test
```

## Develop

* Converts the library of epubs in `/epubs` into a plugin library serving TWPUBs
* Builds a TiddlyWiki including the TWPUB-Tools plugin
* Runs an HTTP server to serve the wiki and the plugin library at http://127.0.0.1:8080/

```
npm start
```

## Build

Builds the files for the app without running the HTTP server

```
npm run build
```

The output files will be in `./output`.

## Clean

Removes the build output in `./output` and the temporary files in `./tmp`.

```
npm run clean
```

## Usage of **epub2twpub**

To run the **epub2twpub** converter:

```
node epub2twpub --epub <path-to-input-epub-file> --output <path-to-output-twpub-file>
```

## Stitching TWPub files into wiki files

The file `./bin/slice-and-stitch-wiki.sh` demonstrates how to stitch a TWPub file into an empty TiddlyWiki wiki file using simple string operations, without using any TiddlyWiki library code. The script invokes a JavaScript app `./bin/stitch-wiki.js` that does the actual stitching.
