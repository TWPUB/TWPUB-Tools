TWPUB is an experiment to explore new formats for electronic publications that encourage readers to reuse and remix material, and support active reading.

We re-imagine electronic publications as dynamic, mouldable, customisable shared cultural assets. Our goal is to create an ecosystem of readers and libraries/stores that make it easy to create and consume these new-style publications. We hope that readers will come for the great experience, publishers will come to reach the readers, and that authors will be delighted with the increased reader engagement.

This prototype is based on [[TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com/]], with [[several experimental enhancements|$:/plugins/immateriel/twpub-tools/docs/tiddlywiki-experiments]].
